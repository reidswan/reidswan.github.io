Welcome to reidswan.com (or reidswan.github.io, depending on how you got here). It's the personal site of Reid Swan (me) - a software engineer with a handful of years of experience. I'm also a guitar student, avid reader, and learning to speak Swedish!

I don't have a solid plan for the blog yet. I might post some of my stronger-held opinions here, and share those learnings as a junior dev that stand out to me the most (and don't violate my NDA). I also plan to post about some of my projects on here (all of which can be seen on my [GitHub][my-github]); at the moment the only standout is [Auxify][auxify], which you can learn more about [here](/projects/auxify). If you're curious, you can learn a bit more about me [here](/about).

As for the website itself, it's a simple [jekyll][jekyll-gh]-powered website, hosted on [GitHub pages][gh-pages], using the [reverie][reverie] jekyll theme.
